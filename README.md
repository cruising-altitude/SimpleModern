# SimpleModern Canvas App Starter Kit

SimpleModern-Tablet is a barebone canvas Power App in the tablet form factor, designed to serve as a highly reusable starting point that minimises the ad-hoc nature of user-interface construction overheads.

## Highlights

+ A screen-specific menu structure that can be collapsed and expanded on demand
+ Any number of items in the menu (although a maximum of 6 or 7 per screen is recommended)
+ Full use of the user's screen real estate with no letterboxing or wasted space
+ Built for modern themes
+ Support for Microsoft 365-style modal dialogues
+ Scrollable content and modal dialogue panes

Screenshots are available.
