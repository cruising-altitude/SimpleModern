# SimpleModern Canvas App Starter Kit

SimpleModern-Tablet is a canvas Power App in the tablet form factor, designed to serve as a highly reusable starting point that reduces user-interface construction overheads.

## Highlights

+ An uncluttered look and feel for effective delivery of content
+ Inspired by the design language found in the Microsoft 365 back-end admin functions
+ A screen-specific menu structure that can be collapsed for more screen real estate
+ Any number of items in the menu (although a maximum of 6 or 7 per screen is recommended)
+ Full use of the user's screen real estate with no letterboxing or wasted space
+ Built for modern themes
+ Support for Microsoft 365-style modal dialogues

Screenshots are available.

## Instructions

Download *SimpleModern-Tablet_PowerApp.zip* and import it to a Power Platform environment as a new canvas app. Then, follow further instructions on MainScreen.

## What's on the roadmap

+ Support for second-level menu items
+ Support for dark mode
